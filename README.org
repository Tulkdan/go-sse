* SSE server in Golang

This is just a POC of a SSE server containing two endpoints, 1 for subscribing and 1 for publishing messages.


** How to run

You can use =just= to run the server locally

#+begin_src shell
just run
#+end_src

** How to use

After running the server, you can subscribe using =curl= with the following command

#+begin_src shell
curl localhost:8000/subscribe
#+end_src

Later, you can simply publish a message in the =/publish= endpoint with the following command

#+begin_src shell
curl localhsot:8000/publish -d '{"name": "Tulkdan", "value": 2000 }'
#+end_src
